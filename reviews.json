The Red Crab Migration was a sight to behold, and snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters was unforgettable. The team's commitment to sustainability and conservation is truly commendable.

Thanks to Christmas Island Expeditions, I was able to explore its hidden gems and learn about its rich history and wildlife. Who knew there could be so many red crabs scurrying over my feet. The team's passion for the island is infectious, and I left feeling inspired and rejuvenated.",

The tour guides were very friendly and tried their hardest to give every member of their tour a personal experience, myself included. The accommodations were top-notch, and the island itself is like paradise on Earth. I wish I could bring a piece of it home with me... I will be returning again and again!",

The tour was organized, and the guides were there. My only complaint is that some of the activities were weather-dependent, so it would have been nice to have options especially during thunderstorms.",

The tour guides were incredibly unprofessional!!!!!!! One of them tried to run off with my wife. Save yourself the trouble and book with a reputable company instead.",
